### Summary
We were tasked with creating an interactive website that displays data describing bacteria in a number of test subjects belly button. The drop down menu on the
website allows users to choose which ID they would like to inspect. After clicking, that user's demographic info and the top ten bacteria in their belly button is 
displayed on a bar chart. Beneath that, a bubble chart displays all of the bacteria found in that user's belly button. JavaScript, the CDN D3, HTML, and Plotly were
the main tools used to create this website.
